            <p class="space-down">Now more than ever is a great time to begin a career as a developer.

                According to U.S. News, web developer is the 8th-best tech career to have, and the Bureau of Labor
                Statistics projects web developer employment to grow 8% over the next decade.

                What makes web development stand out is its resilience in a shrinking COVID-19 job market. Aside from
                commerce, the demand for developers in areas like online banking and remote education is increasing as
                those industries continue to expand and evolve to meet today's needs.

                Thus it's crystal clear that becoming a web developer in 2022 is a smart choice both for now and in the
                future. Let's get into what developers do and how to get started in this industry.</p>

                    Website developers are often more involved with the non-design aspects of web development, though
                    this isn't always the case. Web developers use coding and writing markup to create interactive
                    webpages. These pages can be as simple as online text files, or as complicated as ecommerce sites.
                    No matter the end product, if users are accessing it in their web browser, then there's a good
                    chance that it was built—at least partially—by a web developer.

                    Software development is focused on the programs (or software) used in computer systems. Software
                    developers are responsible for conceptualizing, creating, programming, documenting, testing,
                    improving and maintaining software, software components, and frameworks.

                    Software developers generally create programs and applications for stand-alone desktop and mobile
                    platforms. The software they create allows average users to interact with computer tools for a range
                    of activities and tasks.
